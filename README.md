# GD-Human-Framework

Godot Human generator for Godot 4.5 (tested) and higher.

Based on MakeHuman assets.

## How to enable plugin:

1. Add `res://addons/gd-human-framework/scripts/char_edit_global.gd` as global autoload with name `CharEditGlobal`, otherwise plugin won't work properly.
2. Enable the plugin.

### How to create a character.

After enabling the plugin (v0.0.2 and higher), add `HumanCharacter` node to create your human.

Alternatively, you can run game (v0.1.0 and higher) for customizing a human

You can save blend shapes to GLTF since v0.2.0 (Editor only!) - click "save button" and you will save current config + GLTF baked model.

## TODO.

- [ ] Make all custom types toggleable.

## Yni Viar's commentary

Since **Humanizer gone AGPL** (because of copying MakeHuman code, so **previous versions are affected too!!!**),
I decided to make an alternative human generator.
